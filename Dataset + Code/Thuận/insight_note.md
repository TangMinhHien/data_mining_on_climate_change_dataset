### Global warming potential, the amount of heat trapped by the gas in 100 years, compared to CO2:
- CO2: 1
- CH4: 28
- N2O: 273
- F-gases: varies (12-14800)

# Insights:

## Greenhouse gases:
- In Advanced economies countries, the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) tends to decline. Where as in developping countries, the value was slowly increasing.
- Especially, in the first quarters of 2020 (quarters 40th and some following), it is observed that there was a sudden drop of GHG amongst all regions, which was highly due to Sars-Cov-2 pandemic.
- Most developping countries also had higher methane emission in proportion compared to advanced economies.
- From 2010 to 2023, the proportion of each greenhouse gas were relatively constant.

## By-industry comparison:
- In most regions, the industry emitting the most CO2 was usually Electricity, followed by Manufacturing. However, in developping countries, agriculture, forestry and fishing (AFF) might have a larger carbon-footprint than the above industries. Certain regions even have AFF contributing more than 25% of the total CO2 equivalent (Southeast asia, South asia, Africa, Latin America)
- __Noticably__: the contributions of AFF and Construction industries in the greenhouse effect were not affected by the pandemic.

#### Worldwide:
- The amount of CO2 still tends to increase, but the rate was slowing down.
- CO2 is still the main source of GHG, contributing to more than 75% the total capbability of GHG in the past decade.
- The main source of GHG is Electricity and Manufacturing contributing to more than 50% of total GHG. AFF is also a large source of GHG with more than 15% of the total amount.

## Forest-related stats:
- In general, the area of forest around the world was decreasing slowly, whereas the total area of land kept increasing.
- This led to the diminishment of the total share of forest area, from 32.4% to 31.2%.
- The carbon stocks in forests was de facto declining. Although there is some recovery in 2010-2016, the overall trends was not positive.
- By regions, the carbon stocks was increasing in advanced economies and Asia. In contrast, the carbon stocks tends to decline in most developping countries and regions.
- The same observation can be seen in the share of forest area and forest area, with the exception of the G20 group: The share dropped from 36.3% to 36% and the forest area was also decreased from 2.84 to 2.815 billions HA in the past 32 years.

#### Local observation
- In Vietnam, the data has positive insights as the area of forest and share kept increasing in the past of over 3 decades. Also, the carbon stocks increased from 350 million tonnes to 550 million tonnes.
